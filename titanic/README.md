# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data

This is the legendary Titanic ML competition – the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions and familiarize yourself with how the Kaggle platform works.

The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

## The Challenge

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook, data files, and submission file for the Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition on Kaggle. The goal of this competition is to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not, based on various features such as age, gender, class, etc.

## Repository Contents

1. `KaggleTitanic.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing the entire workflow of the project, from data exploration and preprocessing to model training and evaluation. This file can be opened using Jupyter or any other notebook viewer.

2. `submission.csv`: The final submission file, containing the predictions for the passengers in the `test.csv` dataset. This file should be uploaded to Kaggle for evaluation and scoring.

3. `test.csv`: The test dataset provided by Kaggle, containing the passenger information without the survival labels. This data is used for generating predictions that will be submitted to Kaggle.

4. `train.csv`: The training dataset provided by Kaggle, containing passenger information along with the survival labels. This data is used for training and evaluating the machine learning models.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/Titanic-Kaggle-Repository.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies, such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and seaborn.

3. Open the `KaggleTitanic.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook or any other compatible viewer.

4. Run the cells in the notebook to explore the data, preprocess it, train the model, and generate the predictions.

5. Upload the `submission.csv` file to the [Kaggle competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/submit) to get your score and ranking.
